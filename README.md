iOS with Swift Techdegree Project 1: Soccer Coordinator

You have volunteered to be the coordinator for your town’s youth soccer league. As part of your job you need to divide the 18 children who have signed up for the league into three even teams — Dragons, Sharks, and Raptors. In years past, the teams have been unevenly matched, so this year you are doing your best to fix that. For each child, you will have the following information:

Name,
Height (in inches),
Whether or not they have played soccer before, and
Their guardians’ names.
The project has three major parts. For each part, choose only from the tools we have covered in the courses so far.

Native types and collections to store data (Dictionary, Array, Int, String, etc)
Accessing, appending and counting arrays
Accessing dictionaries and arrays
Creating control flow
Use of comparison operators
String interpolation
Use of comments

** Part 1: ** We have provided information for the 18 players in the Player Info spreadsheet. Please choose an appropriate data type to store the information for each player. In addition, create an empty collection constant to hold all the players’ data. Once you have decided on what tools to use, manually enter the player data so it can be used in Part 2.

** Part 2: ** Create logic to iterate through all 18 players and assign them to teams such that the number of experienced players on each team are the same. Store each team’s players in its own collection for use in Part 3. Please note: your logic should work correctly regardless of the initial ordering of the players and the number of players. This solution should work if there are 18 players or 100.

Also, if you would like to attain an “exceeds expectations” rating for this project, write code to ensure that each team's average height is within 1.5 inches of the others.

** Part 3: ** Write code that iterates through all three teams of players and generates a personalized letter to the guardians, letting them know which team the child has been placed on and when they should attend their first team team practice. As long as you provide the necessary information (player name, team name, guardian names, practice date/time), feel free to have fun with the content of the letter. The team practice dates/times are as follows:

Dragons - March 17, 1pm
Sharks - March 17, 3pm
Raptors - March 18, 1pm
